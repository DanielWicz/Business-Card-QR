**Effective Date:** 2025-08-21

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Business Card QR Creator. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our Android application (the "App").

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our App for you.

### a. Information You Provide Directly

When you create a digital business card or a vCard QR code, you may provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
- Company Name
- Email Address
- LinkedIn Profile URL
- Website URL
- A short description or bio
- A logo or image file from your device's storage (if you choose to embed one)

This information is used solely within the App to generate your QR code and business card. It is processed on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.

### b. Information Collected Automatically

- **Usage Data:** We may collect information on how the App is accessed and used. For example, to manage monetization, we may track the number of times certain features are used to determine when to display an advertisement for non-pro users.
- **Device Information:** We and our third-party partners may collect information about your device, such as its model, operating system version, and IP address.
- **Advertising ID:** The App uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK, which may collect your device's unique Advertising ID (`AD_ID`) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for various purposes:

- **To Provide and Maintain the App:** To generate QR codes and business cards as requested by you.
- **To Personalize Your Experience:** To offer customized QR code designs and business card templates.
- **For Monetization:** To display advertisements to non-pro users and to manage in-app purchases for our Pro features.
- **For Security:** To protect the App and its users from fraud, tampering, and unauthorized access.
- **To Improve the App:** To understand how our users interact with the App and to make improvements.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We use third-party services to operate and improve our App. These services may have access to your information.

- **Google Play Billing Library:** To handle in-app purchases for our Pro features. All payment information is securely handled by Google. We do not store your financial details. We only store a secure, encrypted record of your entitlement status on your device.
- **Google Mobile Ads SDK:** To display advertisements in the App. This service helps us provide free features. Google may use the information it collects to personalize the ads you see. You can learn more about Google's advertising policies here: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
- **Google Play Integrity API:** To ensure the security and integrity of our App and your device. This service helps us prevent abuse by verifying that the App has not been tampered with and is running on a genuine Android device.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

The security of your data is important to us.

- **Local Storage:** All personal information you enter to create a business card (e.g., name, email, company) and any generated QR codes or business cards are stored locally on your device. You have full control to save them to your gallery or delete them.
- **Secure Entitlements:** If you purchase the Pro version, your entitlement status is stored securely on your device using multiple layers of protection, including encryption via the Android Keystore system.
- **Secure File Sharing:** When you share a generated QR code or business card, we use Android's `FileProvider` API to grant secure, temporary access to other apps, preventing the need for broad storage permissions.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
